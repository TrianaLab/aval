# Generate scope from the dependency graph

Goal: one test per unit (package, module, project) whose scope is the unit's
files plus the files of every unit it depends on. A change to a unit re-runs
its test and the tests of the units that depend on it; every other test is
reused.

`aval gen <language>` writes that scope into a `kind: TestSet` from the
repository's real dependency graph. You run it while authoring and commit the
result: `aval run`, `verify` and `push` never call it, and the scope stays
declared in `aval.yaml`.

!!! note "Languages"
    Rust ships ([below](#rust)). The other adapters (Go, JavaScript, Python,
    Java, .NET) are the next stories of
    [Epic 16](https://github.com/TrianaLab/aval/issues/291). `aval gen --help`
    lists the languages your build has.

## What it writes

Given units `a` and `b` where `a` imports `b`, `aval gen go` adds:

```yaml
fragments:
  go.a:
    scope:
      source:
        - a/*.go
  go.b:
    scope:
      source:
        - b/*.go
tests:
  - metadata: {name: go.a}
    runner: {command: [go, test, ./a]}
    use:
      - go.a
      - go.b
  - metadata: {name: go.b}
    runner: {command: [go, test, ./b]}
    use:
      - go.b
```

- One fragment per unit with its own files, one test per unit that `use`s
  the fragments of the unit and of everything it reaches. Aval computes the
  closure; a dependency cycle puts every unit on it in each other's tests.
- Names are `<language>.<unit>`: the unit lower-cased, `/` turned into `.`,
  other characters outside `[a-z0-9._-]` into `-`. A name over 64 characters
  is cut and ends in a hash of the unit. A name depends on its unit alone, so
  adding a unit never renames another. Two units that get the same name are
  an error.
- Entries are sorted by name, so the output is the same on every run and
  platform.

## Ownership

`aval gen go` owns the fragments and tests named `go.*` and nothing else:

- It replaces those entries in place (the first one's position, or the end
  of `fragments` and `tests`) and keeps every other line byte for byte,
  comments and blank lines included. Comment lines right above a later
  generated entry go with it, and a missing final newline is added.
- The prefix is reserved: a hand-written `go.*` entry is replaced.
- Two generators share a file: `aval gen js` owns `js.*` and leaves `go.*`
  alone.
- `fragments` and `tests` must be block style (not `{}` or `[]`).

Shared inputs stay hand-written. Put lockfiles, root build files, the
toolchain, probes, `env` and `cacheability` in `defaults` or in your own
fragments; every generated test inherits `defaults`.

```yaml
apiVersion: aval.trianalab.io/v1
kind: TestSet
defaults:
  scope:
    dependencies: [go.mod, go.sum]
  environment:
    toolchain: {go: "1.25"}
  cacheability: hermetic
fragments:
  go.web:
    scope:
      source:
        - web/*.go
tests:
  - metadata: {name: e2e}   # hand-written, kept as is
    use: [go.web]           # uses a generated fragment
    runner: {command: [make, e2e]}
  - metadata: {name: go.web}
    runner: {command: [go, test, ./web]}
    use:
      - go.web
```

A hand-written test can `use` generated fragments. When the unit behind one
disappears, `aval gen` fails (exit 2) and writes nothing.

## Keep it up to date in CI

```sh
aval gen go --check
```

`--check` writes nothing. It exits 0 when the generated entries match the
graph, and 1 with a diff when they do not, such as a new import or a dropped
one. Run it in the same job as your linters.

## Rust

`aval gen rust` reads the Cargo workspace found from the contract root with
`cargo metadata --no-deps` (no network, no build scripts). Each workspace
member is a unit named after its package: its scope is the member's
directory, its test is `cargo test -p <member>`, and its path dependencies
on other members (normal, dev and build) are its edges. Registry and git
dependencies are not units: put the root `Cargo.toml` (workspace
inheritance) and `Cargo.lock` in `defaults`.

```yaml
apiVersion: aval.trianalab.io/v1
kind: TestSet
defaults:
  scope:
    dependencies: [Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock]
  cacheability: hermetic
fragments:
  rust.domain:
    scope:
      source:
        - crates/domain/**
  rust.store:
    scope:
      source:
        - crates/store/**
tests:
  - metadata: {name: rust.domain}
    runner: {command: [cargo, test, -p, domain]}
    use:
      - rust.domain
  - metadata: {name: rust.store}
    runner: {command: [cargo, test, -p, store]}
    use:
      - rust.domain
      - rust.store
```

- A path dependency on a crate that is not a workspace member, or a member
  outside the contract root, is an error: its files would be in no scope.
- A dev-dependency is an edge like any other, so the tests of a member's
  dependents use its dev-dependencies too: more re-runs, never a stale reuse.
- A package at the workspace root gets `**`: add `target/**` to
  `defaults.scope.exclude`.
- `cargo metadata` does not show `[patch]` or `.cargo/config.toml` path
  overrides. Put those directories in `defaults` by hand.

## Cross-language dependencies

A generator sees one ecosystem. Declare a dependency across languages by
hand only when no shared file carries it. When a Go binary embeds the
frontend build with `go:embed`, or a client SDK is generated into the tree,
those files already sit in a unit's scope. Otherwise add the other side's
fragment to a hand-written test's `use`, or its globs to `defaults`.

## Fail closed

A missing language tool, a parse error, a dependency on an unknown unit or a
unit without files is an error, and nothing is written. Exit codes: 0 written
or up to date, 1 error or `--check` out of date, 2 usage (an unknown
language, no `kind: TestSet` at `-f`, or a result that is not a valid
TestSet).
